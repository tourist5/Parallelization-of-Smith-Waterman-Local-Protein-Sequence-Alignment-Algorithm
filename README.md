Parallel and Distributed computing is the future of technology. All products and their fundamental concepts are being shifted to a parallel computing model. Everybody would agree that serial computing is easy to implement and use, but simply not efficient enough for industry-levelpurposes. Due to this reason, day by day higher number of industries are providing and using cloud solutions which work on the basis on parallel and distributed computing. For instance, Amazon’s AWS or Google’s Google Cloud platform are becoming the centre for development, may it be in the field of web development, or in the field of data analyticsTo cope up with the fast-paced improvement in technology, one must also become familiarized with this domain, and hence this project. Gene sequencing problem is one of the major issues for researchers regarding optimized system models that could help optimum processing and efficiency without introduction overheads in terms of memory andtime. Bio informatics and computational biology is a latest multidisciplinary field which explains many aspects of the fields of computer science, while computational biology harnesses computational approach and technologies to respond biological questions conveniently.
